What are your opinions on Agile software development?
I believe Agile is the most effective development method for rapid development and delivery. Being able to quickly respond to 
changing requirements is a must in today's fast-paced user-centric software environment. However, I do not believe applying 
Agile to every stage of development is wise (for example, code maintenance), but that producing usable documentation must be 
part of the development cycle.

TDD or BDD?
While I do not believe one technique is superior to the other, my choice depends on the type of project I would develop.
I would choose TDD for projects where specific functionality is more important than behavior. For example, an API that needs 
to return information from a database. Simple and precise test cases can be crafted to test the endpoints. However, if I had 
to develop a user-friendly website built from that API, I would choose BDD. User experience is too complex to fit in simple 
and specific test cases. With BDD I can prioritize user experience and satisfaction. 

What are you looking for in a job?
I am looking for a position where I can demonstrate and grow my skills in design, coding, and engineering. I want to be 
part of team where "being a team player" is encouraged. Even though I want to use my Ruby on Rails skills to develop and 
support web applications, I would seek the opportunity to wear "many hats" to learn and help as much as I can.
I want to have a postive impact on my customers through effective communication and design excellence, and to be 
recognized among my peers for my ability to adapt to changes.

Are you legal to work in the US?
Yes 

When can you start?
Immediately 

Anything else we should know.

My preferred IDE for developing Ruby on Rails is RubyMine. It is a very intuitive and smart IDE that will let you focus 
on developing rather than figuring out your setup or finding the right file.

My preferred productivity tool is Barrier (https://github.com/debauchee/barrier). If you have multiple computers, 
it lets you seamlessly use the same mouse and keyboard for all computers.
